<p>My name is James. I'm a tech nerd and I love to break things so I can try to put them back together in interesting ways.</p>

<p>Tech interests are: security and privacy, automation, Linux, and DevOps</p>

<p>Some of the non-geeky things that I like to do include rock climbing, cycling, motorcycles, and photography.</p>
